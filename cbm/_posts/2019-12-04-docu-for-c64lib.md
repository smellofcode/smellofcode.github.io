I have finally managed to set up documentation web site for [c64lib]. It is available under
following link: [https://c64lib.github.io/docu/][docu]

There is a dedicated [news] section where most of the content of this blog is being migrated
(not too much content). I plan to expand this page with manual and howto pages related to
installation and usage. Stay tuned.
