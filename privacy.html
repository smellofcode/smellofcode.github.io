<h2>How your data are processed</h2>
<p>
This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub/GitHub Pages. Jekyll is
not collecting or processing user data in any form. GitHub however, as any other hosting
company, can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc.
Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.
</p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>
This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you accept third party cookies.
I have configured Google Analytics so that IP addresses are anonymized.
</p>
<p>
  Use the following option to grant or revoke collecting data and using cookies.
</p>
<p>
  <input type="checkbox" id="enableGA"> Enable Google Analytics
</p>
<script>
  var useCookies = localStorage.getItem('useCookies');
  document.getElementById('enableGA').checked = (useCookies === 'true');
  var checkbox = document.getElementById('enableGA');
  checkbox.addEventListener('change', function() {
      localStorage.setItem('useCookies', this.checked);
  });
</script>
